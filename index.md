# About this pages
{: .fs-9 }

Welcome to my journey of turning raw data into insightful stories and visual narratives. Here I document my learning process while I search for new ways of understanding, manipulating, and communicating data insights. 
But there's more to it than just numbers. I strongly believe that art and design should be an integral part of data insights. We humans are visual creatures, after all, and art is a form of expression. Explore, learn, and create.
